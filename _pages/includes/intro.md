Welcome to my digital lair, where code meets curiosity, and AI meets an excessive number of open browser tabs. I'm Akshay Nayak, a software engineer, researcher, trekker, and occasional caffeine-fueled philosopher (Full time chef & part time software engineer :))). Currently, I'm deep-diving into Computer Science at George Washington University, crafting algorithms, exploring AI frontiers, and trying to convince machines that they, too, can appreciate good anime.

Previously, I wielded my software engineering magic at Mastercard, architecting scalable solutions and enhancing analytical systems. I also had the privilege of working with the Alan Turing Institute, where I applied machine learning to decode customer sentiments—because sometimes, even algorithms need to figure out what humans really mean.

Beyond the world of neural networks and statistical models, I have a knack for winning hackathons, breaking down complex problems, and occasionally breaking my own code (only to debug it masterfully later). When I’m not coding, you’ll find me binge-watching anime, pondering the mysteries of quantum computing, or building Go-based audio processing tools just for fun.

If you're here to talk AI, software, or the deep philosophical significance of “Dattebayo”, you’re in the right place.

Let’s innovate, collaborate, and maybe argue about the best shonen protagonists. 👨‍💻✨
