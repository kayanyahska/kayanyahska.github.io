Welcome to my digital lair, where **code** meets **curiosity**, and **AI** meets an excessive number of open browser tabs. I'm **Akshay Nayak**, a *software engineer*, *researcher*, *trekker*, and a self-proclaimed *caffeine-fueled philosopher*. (Full-time chef, part-time software engineer, and sometimes a ninja in my free time 😄).

Currently, I'm in the midst of deep-diving into **Computer Science** at **George Washington University**, where I’m crafting algorithms, pushing the boundaries of **AI**, and trying to convince machines that anime is the ultimate art form. (They’re getting there, I promise.)

### Professional Journey (A.K.A. The Fun Stuff):
- **Mastercard**: I used my engineering wizardry at **Mastercard**, crafting scalable solutions, building systems, and generally making everything run smoother than a well-oiled machine.
- **The Alan Turing Institute**: Ever wondered what algorithms think about human emotions? Neither did I—until I worked with the **Alan Turing Institute**, applying **machine learning** to decode customer sentiments. (Turns out, algorithms have *feelings* too... or at least, they try to guess them. 🤖)

---

### Outside of Code (Where the Real Magic Happens):
- I have a special talent for **breaking my own code**, only to put it back together like a master craftsman (sometimes it’s a feature, not a bug).
- When I’m not **debugging** my life choices or my code, I’m binge-watching anime, pondering the *meaning of life* (or at least what happens in the next episode of *Attack on Titan*), and building **Go-based audio tools** for fun. Because why not?

If you're here to talk about **AI**, debate which **shonen protagonist** would win in a fight, or dive into deep thoughts like *“Does quantum computing actually make sense?”*, you're in the right place.

Let’s innovate, collaborate, and maybe argue over the best anime villains. 👨‍💻✨

And of course... **"DATTEBAYO!"** 🌟🌟
